## Description

This project is created to test my skills with JavaScript with MVVM pattern and
Bootstrap.

I also added some basic webpack configuration for easy development and bundling.

## Project setup

1. Download dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the project with the webpack dev server (port 8080):

```bash
npm run start
```

Or build the project and open the html in the browser ("index.html" in the
generated "dist" folder):

```bash
npm run build
```
